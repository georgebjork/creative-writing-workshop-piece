# Cabin

### The Journey

It's mid-December and winter break has just begun. The CR-V is packed with food, sleeping bags, snow boots, and coats. My Dad, sister, and I hug our mom goodbye and get on our way by 1 pm. It’s a long drive to Greenwater from Maple Valley, but not one that is too exhausting. The first half is boring as we take one road through Black Diamond, and then through Enumclaw. It's not until we reach Highway 410 that the real journey begins, and it's here we’re reminded why we do this.  All around us are trees, and the Douglas Fir’s reaches its long branches over the road creating an umbrella for us to drive underneath. As we venture deeper down the highway, we begin to lose cell service, and the trees begin to show evidence of a light dusting of snow. Soon the road disappears under a blanket of snow and travel begins to slow. After about an hour, we reach our first landmark, Wapiti Woolies. It’s a small ski lodge for us to stretch our legs and get huckleberry smoothies. Even in the middle of winter, it's tradition to get smoothies. After our pitstop, we drive for another 20 minutes where we reach our last and final landmark, the Dalles Campground. Across the Dalles is where we need to go, but a steep snow-covered hill stands in our way. We begin to drive up. The road is narrow and is only able to accomandate one car at a time. The road is also icy and to our left is steep drop down 100 feet. The car is struggling up the hill and suddendly the back of the car starts to kick out and slide towards the edge and my sister begins to scream. My dad is able to stop the car before it keeps sliding and gets out to get the chains as he admits under his breath that he probably should've start with the chains. After about 15 minutes the chains are on and the car churns up the rest of the hill. At the top we’re greeted with a sign reading, “Lane Family Cabin”, and a small bridge leading over a raging river. After we cross the bridge, we are presented with stone steps leading up the side of a hill. We climb up the hill, being careful about where to place our feet, and at the top, we finally see the Lane Cabin.


### Arrival 

It’s a small building, with cedar plank siding and a metal roof. On the far-right side, there is a moss-covered stone chimney rising up and over the roof. There is an opening directly to the right of the chimney. It’s a covered walkway with split wood lined up to the ceiling on each side. There is a wood sign over each section with carved labels saying “Woodstove” and “Fireplace”.  In the end, there is a door with a padlock. My dad takes off his gloves and quickly puts in the combo and opens the door. It's dark inside and it smells of burnt wood. It’s the kind of smell that I will never forget. Presented immediately in front of us is the living room. It has 3 couches and a coffee table in the middle. Across from the couches is the stone fireplace we walked by outside. On its wood mantel, there are some candles and pictures. In the back of the cabin, there is a small kitchen with black and white tile in the very back of the cabin. The kitchen has a “U” shaped counter with cupboards above each counter. There’s an ancient-looking wood stove. It's all white with its paint peeling on the corners. To the right of the kitchen, there is a sunken-down living room. In this living room, there is a wall of windows reaching well over 15 feet high. Each window is a single pane window, each with a slightly different shape, that raises into an arch at the top. Looking out the windows there is a beautiful scene of mossy trees and snow-dusted branches. Supporting the ceiling are two sets of metal crossbars suspended in the air. In the living room, there is one more couch, and a long table with 2 propane lights suspended above. My dad directs me to the stone fireplace to start a fire, while he starts a fire in the wood-burning stove in the kitchen and the secondary wood stove in the lower living room. The temperature currently reads 36 degrees inside the cabin, well off of our 65-degree goal. We get to work starting the fires. 

### Evening

About 2 hours have now passed since we arrived. The cabin has slowly been warming it become completely dark outside. The only light available is the propane lights giving off a soft warm glow and the fireplaces roaring away. The wood stove has finally heated to the temperature to heat our frozen dinner. Mom cooked us Spaghetti pie, my favorite. My dad pops it in the oven and starts a timer on his phone. While we wait, we decide it's time to bring out the card games. Our favorite is BS, it's an easy game to start with. While we play, my sister and I sip on Hot Coco while my dad drinks a beer. I’m not quite old enough yet, but maybe next year. Before long, my dad’s timer goes off and we serve up dinner. There’s something different about the food that’s eaten at the cabin. It’s an unexplainable phenomenon, but it feels more real. After dinner games continue, we play Yahtzee, Memory, and Rack-O. Time flies by as we enjoy the time together away from the world and our phones. All we need is each other’s company in the presence of God’s beautiful creation. Before we know it, it's 11 o’clock and we’re all getting ready for bed. My dad always opts to sleep in the lower living room to man the small stove, and I sleep in the other living room to man the big fireplace. My sister Lily, however, heads up a small ladder by the front door to a loft. In the loft, there is a full-size mattress and a twin. Next to the ladder is two 2x4s leading along the top of a support beam, and then two more 2x4’s perpendicular lead across to the other loft, where my sister always chooses to sleep. Over there is the same arrangement as the first loft. I pull off the back cushions on the couch facing the fireplace and crawl into my sleeping bag. The room is silent, except for the crackling cedar wood in the fireplace.

### Departure

I wake up to sunlight pouring in through the windows of the cabin. The fire is still burning in the fireplace and my dad is up making breakfast. He’s making eggs and sausage in the skillet and already has a cup of coffee ready for me. My sister wakes up 20 minutes later and we all eat breakfast together. After breakfast, we throw our paper plates in the fireplace and start beginning to clean up. We first pack up all of our things and then start sweeping and dusting, all the while letting the fires slowly burn out. We’re out the door by 10:30, and ready to go. It snowed again last night and our footprints in the snow are now almost entirely gone. It becomes even more evident as we reach our car which now has a mountain fresh of snow on it. We brush off the snow and head back down the hill and get back on the road. We stop one more time at Wapiti Woolies for more smoothies before we finish our trek home. As we drive, we slowly regain cell services. Texts and notifications slowly begin to funnel in as we return into the real world. Our annual trip is over, but we’re looking forward to doing it again. 



### Reflection 

As you may have noticed, I wrote this piece in an unfamilar format for a lot of people. I took heavy inspiration from the first prompt where it was to adapt a form of writing you're familiar with a differnt style of writing. I chose to adapt technical writing into creative writing. Technical writing is a form of writing I interact with almost everyday. This document called a markdown document and is used to describe large code bases. Here is an example of what this might look like in practice: [Example](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). I wanted to incorporate elements of how these documents are typically structured in my writing so I broke it up into sections with headers and added a table of contents(even though its not super necessary).

Because these documents are generally used to describe something, I got inspriation to describe a memory in my life, which was going to the family cabin every winter my sister and dad. I tried hard to challenge myself to describe a difficult to describe scene like the my family cabin. I wrote this entirely from my own perspective where you can only hear my own thoughts and no one elses. I also wanted to challenge myself to write more than I usually would (so sorry for that!) rather than just meeting the minimum requirements. Because this is a happy memory for me, I wasnt able to add a lot of tension, but I tried to add some as we tried to drive up to the cabin because that is a legitamently scary drive. 

What I want feedback about is, could you visualize the scene I was seeing? I was trying to describe it without overdoing the detail but still have plenty to paint a clear picture. What needs to be added? What needs to be removed?

I tagged some pictures below so you could see what the cabin actually is like to help paint a better picture in your head.
